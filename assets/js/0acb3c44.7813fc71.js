Therefore it should be linked with a clear reintroduction process of the bought back tokens (through the redistribution of these tokens as fidelity tokens for example). Especially, if these bought back tokens are reintroduced thanks to a cashback mechanism towards the customer of the collateral service, this potential disadvantage would be negated.
