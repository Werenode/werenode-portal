Werenode is proud to announce that its smart contracts are now entering Tezos' main net. Eager at spurring the development of the EV charging infrastructure, whether public or private, we have designed with our partner Edukera a set of Tezos smart contracts which allows to build an open framework for safe and auditable EV charging payment.
