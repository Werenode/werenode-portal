# Introducing the DID-IMP Test Version: Securing Digital Identity with Decentralization

We are proud to announce the **test release** of the **DID-IMP** application ‚Äî a decentralized identity infrastructure designed to securely manage and automate data exchange across Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems.

## üîê What is DID-IMP?

**DID-IMP** (Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure for Defended IoT Data Management and Procurement) provides a secure and scalable framework for managing digital identities of connected devices. It uses **decentralized identifiers (DIDs)**, **verifiable credentials (VCs)**, and **smart contracts** to ensure trust, traceability, and automation in device-to-device interactions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Capabilities

- **Automated, Fee-less Data Exchange**: Devices can authenticate and exchange data without central coordination ‚Äî using smart contracts deployed on the Alastria blockchain.
- **Embedded Wallets for Devices**: Manage signing keys and transaction authorizations directly within connected hardware.
- **Modular Software Architecture**: Includes reusable components for DID & VC management, service registries, and device-level delegation.
- **Web and Mobile dApp Interface**: Built with Angular, our web application enables easy interaction with DIDs, credentials, and history.
- **Seamless Integration**: Ready to interface with a broad range of IoT protocols and infrastructures ‚Äî from smart buildings to industrial fleets.

## üéØ Why a Test Version?

This release is part of our validation process under the TrustChain NGI initiative. We invite developers, IoT operators, and cybersecurity experts to test the system, evaluate its performance, and provide feedback.

## üì• Try It Out

[DID-IMP web application](https://did-imp.werenode.io)

Developers can access the source code and test interfaces here:
- Dashboard UI: [github.com/NGI-TRUSTCHAIN/DID-IMP](https://github.com/NGI-TRUSTCHAIN/DID-IMP)
- Smart Contracts and deployment tools are included and documented.

## üí° What‚Äôs Next?

The DID-IMP test version lays the foundation for a future of decentralized, verifiable, and secure IoT systems. Your feedback will help us improve UI/UX, integration workflows, and security resilience.

*Be part of shaping the future of decentralized identity. Join the test phase, build with us, and let‚Äôs make data trustless ‚Äî yet trusted.*
