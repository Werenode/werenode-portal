# Getting Started with Werenode

Welcome to **Werenode**! This guide will help you get started with our decentralized electric vehicle (EV) charging platform. Whether you're an EV driver, a charging station owner, or a developer, we have everything you need to start using the Werenode ecosystem effectively.

## What is Werenode?

Werenode is a blockchain-powered platform that offers a decentralized solution for EV charging. It connects electric vehicle drivers, charging station operators, and service providers through a combination of mobile applications, a web portal, and smart contracts to provide transparent, secure, and scalable charging solutions.

### Key Components of the Werenode Ecosystem

- **Mobile App**: A cross-platform app built with React Native that allows drivers to locate charging stations, initiate charging, and make payments.
- **Web Portal**: Built with Docusaurus, this portal serves as a hub for documentation, EVSE management, and user resources.
- **Member App**: An Angular-based app that provides detailed charging session information for Werenode members.
- **DEFev**: A fully decentralized web application that uses MetaMask to connect with the blockchain, allowing direct wallet interactions.

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Werenode Account

To start using Werenode, you'll need to create an account:

1. **Download the Mobile App**: The Werenode mobile app is available for both Android and iOS. Download it from your device’s app store.
2. **Create an Account**: Open the app, select "Sign Up," and provide the required information. You can also link your blockchain wallet to facilitate easy payments.
3. **Verify Your Email**: A verification email will be sent to you. Click on the link to activate your account.

Once your account is set up, you’re ready to find and use charging stations.

## Step 2: Locating and Using a Charging Station

The Werenode mobile app makes it easy to find and use charging stations:

1. **Open the Map**: Open the Werenode app and use the map feature to find a nearby charging station.
2. **Filter and Search**: Use filters to narrow down stations by availability, pricing, and charging speed.
3. **Start a Charging Session**: Once you arrive at the station, tap on its icon in the app and click "Start Charging." 
4. **Payment**: Confirm the payment using your integrated wallet or use the DEFev app with MetaMask for a decentralized experience.

## Step 3: Managing Your Charging Sessions

You can manage your charging sessions in real-time through the mobile app or the **Member App**:

- **Mobile App**: Shows the current charging session, progress, and estimated completion time.
- **Member App**: Provides detailed information about past charging sessions, including energy consumed, cost, and charging duration.

## Step 4: Using the Werenode Web Portal

The Werenode Web Portal, built with Docusaurus, provides useful resources for developers, charging station owners, and other stakeholders:

- **Documentation**: Learn how to install, operate, and manage Werenode charging stations.
- **EVSE Management**: Charging station owners can register and manage their equipment.
- **Developer Resources**: Explore guides for integrating blockchain payments and extending Werenode functionality.

## Step 5: Exploring Blockchain and DEFev

Werenode is powered by blockchain technology, ensuring all payments are secure, transparent, and decentralized. You can use **DEFev**, our alternative decentralized app, to manage charging sessions:

- **MetaMask Wallet**: Connect your MetaMask wallet to the DEFev web application for direct interactions with blockchain smart contracts.
- **Decentralized Payments**: Pay directly using tokens, without any intermediaries, ensuring complete user control.
