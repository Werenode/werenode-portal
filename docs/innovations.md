# Innovation Projects

Werenode is committed to advancing electric vehicle (EV) charging technologies by developing innovative solutions that leverage blockchain, IoT, decentralized identity, and cutting-edge user interfaces. This document highlights our key innovation projects: **DEFev**, **DID-IMP**, **IOTPAY**, and the **Alexa Speech HMI version** of Werenode, developed in collaboration with Renault's **ElectroShaker Lab**.

## DEFev - Decentralized EV Charging Management

**DEFev** is a fully decentralized web application designed to provide a seamless user experience for managing EV charging using blockchain technology. DEFev aims to empower users with complete control over their EV charging transactions and data.

### Key Features:

- **Blockchain Payments**: DEFev allows users to directly manage payments for charging using blockchain-based wallets, such as **MetaMask**. This ensures a secure and decentralized payment solution without intermediaries.
- **Web3 Integration**: DEFev leverages **Web3.js** to directly interact with the blockchain, enabling users to connect their wallets and interact with Werenode's smart contracts for EV charging.
- **User Autonomy**: The decentralized architecture means users have full control over their payments and transactions, with all interactions being transparent and recorded on the blockchain.
- **Multi-Chain Support**: DEFev supports both **Tezos** and **Binance Smart Chain** tokens—**Werecoin (WRC)** and **BWRC**, respectively—providing flexibility for users.

### Benefits:

- **Full Transparency**: Transactions are recorded on-chain, ensuring full transparency for both charging station operators and EV drivers.
- **Secure Payments**: By using blockchain wallets like MetaMask, DEFev eliminates the risk of intermediaries, ensuring fast and secure transactions.
- **Seamless User Experience**: With the **Plug&Charge** feature, users can enjoy a simplified charging process, requiring minimal interaction to initiate a charging session.

## DID-IMP - Decentralized Identity for Interoperable Mobility Platform

**DID-IMP** is Werenode’s **Decentralized Identity** project aimed at creating a secure and private way for users to authenticate and interact with the Werenode ecosystem.

### Key Features:

- **Decentralized Identity (DID)**: DID-IMP leverages **Decentralized Identity** to allow users to authenticate across different platforms without relying on centralized authorities. This ensures data privacy and control over user credentials.
- **Interoperability**: The platform enables users to authenticate and use multiple EV services seamlessly, thanks to a decentralized and open identity protocol. This interoperability is a key step towards achieving a unified and user-friendly EV charging experience across different networks and service providers.
- **Privacy-Preserving**: DID-IMP ensures that users’ personal information is not stored on centralized servers, reducing the risk of data breaches. The decentralized architecture ensures that only the necessary information is shared in a secure and encrypted manner.

### Benefits:

- **Enhanced User Privacy**: Users are in control of their own data, allowing for more secure and privacy-preserving interactions.
- **Reduced Dependence on Central Authorities**: With decentralized identities, users can move between different platforms and services without the need for multiple login credentials.
- **Streamlined Charging Experience**: DID-IMP allows users to access charging stations across the Werenode network and partner services without the need to create multiple accounts.

## IOTPAY - IoT-Based Payment Solution for EV Charging

**IOTPAY** is Werenode's innovative payment solution that integrates **Internet of Things (IoT)** technology with blockchain to facilitate seamless and secure payments for EV charging.

### Key Features:

- **IoT Integration**: IOTPAY enables the integration of **IoT-connected devices**, such as Shelly plugs and other smart charging points, to enable direct and automated payment processing for EV charging sessions.
- **Blockchain-Based Payment Processing**: Payments are executed using smart contracts on **Tezos** or **Binance Smart Chain**, ensuring secure and immutable transactions. This makes the payment process transparent and accessible to both EV users and charging station operators.
- **Real-Time Charging Control**: IOTPAY allows EV owners to initiate, pause, and stop charging sessions using a connected plug, with payment being processed in real time. This provides users with flexibility and complete control over their charging activities.

### Benefits:

- **Automated Payments**: Users can enjoy fully automated payments without needing to manually approve transactions for each charging session.
- **Enhanced Security**: By integrating IoT with blockchain, IOTPAY ensures that payment data is secure and cannot be tampered with.
- **Low Transaction Costs**: The use of blockchain allows for micro-transactions with significantly reduced costs compared to traditional payment gateways.

## Alexa Speech HMI Version - In Collaboration with Renault's ElectroShaker Lab

Werenode has partnered with Renault's **ElectroShaker Lab** to develop an **Alexa Speech HMI (Human-Machine Interface)** version of the Werenode app. This collaboration aims to provide a hands-free, voice-activated solution for managing EV charging, making the experience more user-friendly and accessible.

### Key Features:

- **Alexa Voice Integration**: This version integrates **Amazon Alexa**, allowing users to use voice commands to interact with the Werenode platform. Users can locate charging stations, initiate charging sessions, and monitor their progress using simple voice commands.
- **User-Friendly HMI**: The speech interface was designed to provide a highly accessible user experience. Users can easily manage their EV charging activities while on the go, without having to interact with a touchscreen or mobile app.
- **Real-Time Information**: Users can ask Alexa to provide real-time information, such as charging status, available charging stations nearby, and session costs.

### Benefits:

- **Hands-Free Convenience**: The Alexa Speech HMI allows users to manage charging without needing to physically interact with a mobile device, adding a layer of convenience and safety, especially while driving.
- **Collaboration with Industry Leader**: By collaborating with Renault's ElectroShaker Lab, Werenode is at the forefront of integrating automotive technology with voice-driven interfaces.
- **Enhanced Accessibility**: The speech interface makes the Werenode app more accessible to users who may prefer or need voice control, including individuals with disabilities.
