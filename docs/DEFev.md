# Innovation Project - DEFev

Werenode is committed to advancing electric vehicle (EV) charging technologies and decentralized energy solutions by developing innovative components that leverage blockchain, IoT, decentralized identity, and cutting-edge user interfaces. This document highlights one of our key innovation projects: **DEFev**, DLT Ecosystem For Electric Vehicle Charging. We have also developed several other Web3.0 systems: **DID-IMP**, **IOTPAY**, **DECO** developed in collaboration with **OP Mobility** and **SII**, the **Alexa Speech HMI version** of Werenode, developed in collaboration with Renault's **ElectroShaker Lab**, and the **LG Web OS** version of our application, developed in collaboration with **LG Nova**.

## DEFev - Decentralized EV Charging Management

**DEFev** is a fully decentralized web application designed to provide a seamless user experience for managing EV charging using blockchain technology. DEFev aims to empower users with complete control over their EV charging transactions and data.

### Key Features:

- **Blockchain Payments**: DEFev allows users to directly manage payments for charging using blockchain-based wallets, such as **MetaMask**. This ensures a secure and decentralized payment solution without intermediaries.
- **Web3 Integration**: DEFev leverages **Web3.js** to directly interact with the blockchain, enabling users to connect their wallets and interact with Werenode's smart contracts for EV charging.
- **User Autonomy**: The decentralized architecture means users have full control over their payments and transactions, with all interactions being transparent and recorded on the blockchain.
- **Multi-Chain Support**: DEFev supports both **Tezos** and **Binance Smart Chain** tokens—**Werecoin (WRC)** and **BWRC**, respectively—providing flexibility for users.

## Architecture & Protocol

The architecture of DEFev comprises several core components:

1) Public Blockchain Network: Serves as the foundational layer, ensuring transparency and security.
2) Smart Contracts: Automate the management of the charging session and its payment.
3) Decentralized Wallet: DEFev is fully Web3.0 and utilizes Metamask.
4) User Interface: A web application to locate and identify the ev charging equipement, to trigger or interrupt the sessions, with additional features.

### Benefits:

- **Full Transparency**: Transactions are recorded on-chain, ensuring full transparency for both charging station operators and EV drivers.
- **Secure Payments**: By using blockchain wallets like MetaMask, DEFev eliminates the risk of intermediaries, ensuring fast and secure transactions.
- **Seamless User Experience**: With the **Plug&Charge** feature, users can enjoy a simplified charging process, requiring minimal interaction to initiate a charging session.
