Why Web3.0 ?
</h1>

Interoperability is crucial in the fragmented ecosystem of charging stations. We need a secure and open traceability and payment system where other operators can join easily. 
A public ledger is also required to audit energy use, especially in complex cases like Smart Charge, V2G, Plug&Charge, etc…. When it comes to P2P payments and disintermediation, Web3.0 and blockchain are here !

## Werecoin and Smart Contrats

Werenode's token is Werecoin (WRC). Werenode has chosen a multichain strategy to take advantage of different key strongpoints, implemented differently by several major blockchains. Werenode started historically with a Tezos token, to take advantage of the first environmentally friendly and evolutive major blokchain using PoS (Proof of Stake) validation, and benefitting from a very low cost of transaction. The **[WRC](https://tzkt.io/KT19Fmya7B49wKYdoqXYphyQWGRUn9g5wG8R/operations/)** address is :
> KT19Fmya7B49wKYdoqXYphyQWGRUn9g5wG8R 

The token can also be bought on the Binance Smart Chain. The **[BWRC](https://biswap.org/fr/swap?inputCurrency=BNB&outputCurrency=0xcb2B11e8B780971907A9A171754C7D767ee8Bc70)** token address is : 
> 0xcb2B11e8B780971907A9A171754C7D767ee8Bc70

The token can also be bought on the Ethereum Chain. The **[EWRC](https://app.uniswap.org/explore/tokens/ethereum/0x1d801fb8b2ed31b9990d7a2272a11c2c1d0a25b6)** token address is : 
> 0x1D801fB8b2ED31b9990D7A2272A11c2c1D0a25b6

All other contracts on Tezos or on other Blockchains are obsolete or not related to us. Beware of scams.

# Understanding Werenode's Multi-Chain Strategy

Werenode leverages blockchain technology to provide a transparent, efficient, and decentralized platform for electric vehicle (EV) charging. As part of this initiative, Werenode has created three tokens: **Werecoin (WRC)**, based on the Tezos blockchain, **Binance Smart Chain Werecoin (BWRC)**, deployed on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and **Ethereum Werecoin (EWRC)**, built on Ethereum chain. This guide will explain these tokens, their use cases, and how you can interact with them. The overall total of tokens if fixed to 89.5B tokens. There will never be more tokens than this total. However, the amount of tokens on each blockchain can vary. Currently there are 19.5B WRC on Tezos, 60B BWRC on BSC and 10B EWRC on Ethereum. 

## Overview

Werenode has designed its cryptocurrency ecosystem around **multi-chain interoperability**. This means that users can benefit from different blockchain features by utilizing tokens on **Tezos**, **Binance Smart Chain**, and **Ethereum**. These tokens serve as the basis for EV charging payments, staking, and other services within the Werenode ecosystem.

### 1. Werecoin (WRC) on Tezos Blockchain

**Werecoin (WRC)** is a utility token on the Tezos blockchain, based on the **FA2 token standard**. This token supports Werenode's payment infrastructure, allowing users to pay for EV charging services. The choice of Tezos was motivated by its energy efficiency, security, and low transaction fees. As a state of fact, Werenode and its Werecoins are part of the history of Tezos: our first smart contract on Tezos blockchain was the 39th. Anyway, we never received any funding by Tezos management who was more interested in football (soccer) and Formula 1 sponsoring. The current total supply of WRC is 19.5B. All the transaction volumes traded on Tezos blockchain are invisible to Coinmarketcap.

**Key Features of Werecoin on Tezos:**

- **FA2 Standard**: Werecoin is implemented using the **FA2 standard**, which is a flexible token standard on the Tezos blockchain. This standard supports various token types, including fungible, non-fungible, and multi-asset tokens.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. Why does Werenode use three different blockchains?
Werenode uses **Tezos**, **Binance Smart Chain**, and **Ethereum** to leverage the unique strengths of each blockchain—Tezos for its energy-efficient and secure Proof of Stake consensus, Binance Smart Chain for its fast transactions and DeFi compatibility, and Ethereum for its leadership. This multi-chain approach enhances flexibility for users and provides more options for interacting with the Werenode ecosystem.

### 2. How can I convert WRC to BWRC or EWRC?
You can swap between WRC (Tezos), BWRC (BSC), and EWRC (Ethereum) using supported cross-chain platforms. Detailed instructions for swapping will be provided through the Werenode platform when the feature is available. We currently collaborate with TokEngine project to develop a dedicated multichain bridge solution.

### 3. Can I use WRC, BWRC, and EWRC for other services beyond EV charging?
Yes, **WRC**, **BWRC**, and **EWRC** can be used within the Werenode ecosystem, including staking, rewards, and participation in decentralized finance (DeFi) activities on the respective blockchain networks.

### 4. Why did we start with Tezos ?
Tezos is an innovative blockchain with smart contracts in mind. Media and pundits show a growing interest  (https://www.cryptodaily.co.uk/2021/10/Tezos-Listed-By-Bank-Of-America-As-Most-Undervalued-Crypto)

- Tezos is Green thanks to its LPoS protocol. Electricity should be used to charge cars not to run miners :)
It’s one of most ascetic in Wh per transaction.
- Tezos Foundation is continuously improving efficiency of the smart contracts and thanks to experts from Edukera and Nomadics Labs we have formally proven contracts, optimized storage and open ledger.
- Tezos is fast enough to serve real life transactions: blocks last 30 secs and transaction bandwidth is around 40 TPS.
- Most of our Tezos transactions cost below $0.01, making it a perfect match for charging micro transactions (around $5-$10). An ERC20 transaction on Ethereum costs more. L2 initiatives or the Binance chain BSC is a great improvement but BEP20 token swaps on Pancakeswap still cost around $0.30. 

We don't believe in 'One Blockchain To Rule Them All'. The crypto universe has proven to be very agile and in constant movement. We believe in protocols designed for a purpose, interoperability between blockchains, DEX more decentralized bridges, stablecoins and utility tokens all together.

Our Tezos smart contracts are developed with Archetype, the high level smart contract language built for formal verification (developed by our partners and friends from Edukera).

## Conclusion

**Werecoin (WRC)** on the Tezos blockchain, **Binance Smart Chain Werecoin (BWRC)**, and **Ethereum Werecoin (EWRC)** are crucial elements of Werenode's vision for a decentralized EV charging network. By providing multiple options for users to participate in the charging economy, Werenode ensures flexibility, scalability, and enhanced utility for its community members.
