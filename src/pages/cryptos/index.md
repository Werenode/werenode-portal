Why Cryptos
</h1>

Interoperability is crucial in the fragmented ecosystem of charging stations. We need a secure and open payment system where other operators can join easily. 
A public ledger is also required to audit energy use, especially in complex cases like Smart Charge, V2G, Plug&Charge, etc…. When it comes to P2P payments and disintermediation, cryptos are here !

## Presenting the project

You will find all the information about Werenode in the [White Paper](https://werenode.com/documents/Werenode_whitepaper_22_01_10.pdf)

Or you can begin with the condensed [Lite Paper](https://werenode.com/documents/Werenode_Litepaper_21_12_03.pdf)


## Why Tezos ?

Tezos is an innovative blockchain with smart contracts in mind. Media and pundits show a growing interest  (https://www.cryptodaily.co.uk/2021/10/Tezos-Listed-By-Bank-Of-America-As-Most-Undervalued-Crypto)

- Tezos is Green thanks to its LPoS protocol. Electricity should be used to charge cars not to run miners :)
It’s one of most ascetic in Wh per transaction.

- Tezos Foundation is continuously improving efficiency of the smart contracts and thanks to experts from Edukera and Nomadics Labs we have formally proven contracts, optimized storage and open ledger.

- Tezos is fast enough to serve real life transactions: blocks last 30 secs and transaction bandwidth is around 40 TPS.

- Most of our Tezos transactions cost below $0.01, making it a perfect match for charging micro transactions (around $5-$10). An ERC20 transaction on Ethereum costs $40. A Uniswap swap is quoted $124 at the time of writing. L2 initiatives or the Binance chain BSC is a great improvement but BEP20 token swaps on Pancakeswap still cost around $0.50. 

We don't believe in 'One Blockchain To Rule Them All'. The crypto universe has proven to be very agile and in constant movement. We believe in protocols designed for a purpose, interoperability between blockchains, CEX and DEX, stablecoins and utility tokens all together.

Our smart contracts are developed with Archetype, the high level smart contract language built for formal verification.

## Werecoin and Smart Contrats

Werenode is using a Tezos token called Werecoin, shorten in WRC. The address is :
> KT19Fmya7B49wKYdoqXYphyQWGRUn9g5wG8R 

The token can also be bought on the Binance Smart Chain. The token address is : 
> 0xbCe2B12e3aA25225ed716c09C464dF528B1E5916

All other contracts on Tezos or on other Blockchains are obsolete or not related to us. 
Beware of scams.
Please don't use the first token KT1LqEyTQ...qazAwXrg4t
