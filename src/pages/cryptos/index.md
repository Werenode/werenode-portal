# Why Cryptos

Interoperability is crucial in the fragmented ecosystem of charging stations. We need a secure and open payment system where other operators can join easily. 
A public ledger is also required to audit energy use, especially in complex cases like Smart Charge, V2G, Plug&Charge, etc…. When it comes to P2P payments and disintermediation, cryptos are here !

## Why Tezos ?

Tezos is an innovative blockchain with smart contracts in mind. Media and pundits show a growing interest  (https://www.cryptodaily.co.uk/2021/10/Tezos-Listed-By-Bank-Of-America-As-Most-Undervalued-Crypto)

- Tezos is Green thanks to its LPoS protocol. Electricity should be used to charge cars not to run miners :)
It’s the one of most ascetic in Wh per transaction.

- Tezos Foundation is continuously improving efficiency of the smart contracts and thanks to experts from Edukera and Nomadics Labs we have formally proven contracts, optimized storage and open ledger.

- Tezos is fast enough to serve real life transactions: blocks last 30 secs and transaction bandwidth is around 40 TPS.

- Most of our Tezos transactions cost below $0.01, making it a perfect match for charging micro transactions (around $5-$10). An ERC20 transaction on Ethereum costs $40. A Uniswap swap is quoted $124 at the time of writing. L2 initiatives or the Binance chain BSC is a great improvement but BEP20 token swaps on Pancakeswap still cost around $0.50. 

We don't believe in 'One Blockchain To Rule Them All'. The crypto universe has proven to be very agile and in constant movement. We believe in protocols designed for a purpose, interoperability between blockchains, CEX and DEX, stablecoins and utility tokens all together.

```All other contracts on Tezos or on other Blockchains are inactive or not related to us. 
Beware of scams.```
