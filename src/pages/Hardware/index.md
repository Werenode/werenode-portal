Basically, if your charging device can be connected to the Internet, it can work with the Werenode app. Our solution is not hardware specific. Let’s see that in details :

## Wallboxes
If your wallbox is connected and compatible with the OCPP standard, then that’s an easy game. It can natively integrate Werenode environment without any change on your equipment.

## EV Chargers
EV Chargers are rarely OCPP compliant. We have an IoT server to connect to certain EV Chargers and we are extending it to be compatible with more and more models.
